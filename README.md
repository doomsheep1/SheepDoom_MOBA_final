## Project description
This project is a solo continuation of a huge self-directed **school project by a team** to develop a multiplayer online battle arena game (MOBA) for **android devices**. The game follows a standard formula where players form 2 teams with each player choosing from a few characters, each with different characteristics. The 2 teams will oppose each other and achieve map objectives (e.g., kill opposing team’s forces, occupy capture points etc.).

6. [Original project](https://github.com/ItsLame/SheepDoom_MOBA/tree/New-pooplord-playground)

My contributions include development of SheepDoom’s networking infrastructure and general game mechanics. This project is a fork of the original where I [@doomsheep1](https://github.com/doomsheep1) attempt to continue refining it on my own and to test new things that I have learnt or picked up.
## Development environment
1. Unity game engine (C#)
2. [ParrelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync)
3. Blender (maybe)
## [Mirror networking](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/)
The mobile game utilizes mirror networking as its networking solution to connect players with each other. We developed a single-server architecture that can run multiple player-hosted lobbies.
1. The game is client-authoritative
2. [The transport protocol used is KCP (with UDP as its underlying protocol)](https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp/blob/master/README.en.md)
